Python is the useful programming language for the science, web development and IoT. Here I uploaded the some of python tutorials for beginers.

We easily manage the Python and its packages by using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
Please download the latest version of the Python and install on your own operating system [Link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

If you do not want to install the python on our computer, you can also try it in your browser by using online jupyter server : [Link1](https://jupyter.org/try) or [Link2](https://kyso.io/)
