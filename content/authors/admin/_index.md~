I am graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Seoul National University, South Korea, working with [Prof. Jongchul Chae](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7073-868X) for my PhD degree. I plan to graduate PhD course in February, 2020. My research interests are theoretical ana observational solar physics in the areas of sunspot waves. The primary goal is to understand the generation of sunspot waves. Recentely I have studied the nature of spiral wave patterns in sunspots (see [publications](#publications))
